        <h2 class="sub-heading"> Artificial intelligence</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Senior Audrey Lorvo is researching AI safety, which seeks to ensure increasingly intelligent AI models are reliable and can benefit humanity.
        The growing field focuses on technical challenges like robustness and AI alignment with human values, as well as societal concerns like transparency and accountability.
        Practitioners are also concerned with the potential existential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI tools.</p>
        <p class="post-text">“Ensuring AI isn’t misused or acts contrary to our intentions is increasingly important as we approach artificial general intelligence (AGI),” 
        says Lorvo, a computer science, economics, and data science major.
        AGI describes the potential of artificial intelligence to match or surpass human cognitive capabilities.</p>
        <p class="post-text">An MIT Schwarzman College of Computing Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) scholar, Lorvo looks closely at how AI might automate AI research and 
            development processes and practices. A member of the Big Data research group, she’s investigating the social and economic implications associated with AI’s potential to 
            accelerate research on itself and how to effectively communicate these ideas and potential impacts to general audiences including legislators, strategic advisors, and others.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Lorvo emphasizes the need to critically assess AI’s rapid advancements and their implications, ensuring organizations have proper frameworks and strategies in place 
        to address risks. “We need to both ensure humans reap AI’s benefits and that we don’t lose control of the technology,”
        she says. “We need to do all we can to develop it safely.”</p>
        <p class="post-text">Her participation in efforts like the AI Safety Technical Fellowship reflect her investment in understanding the technical aspects of AI safety. The fellowship provides opportunities to review existing research on 
            aligning AI development with considerations of potential human impact. “The fellowship helped me understand AI safety’s technical questions and challenges so I can potentially propose better AI governance strategies,” she says.
            According to Lorvo, companies on AI’s frontier continue to push boundaries, 
            which means we’ll need to implement effective policies that prioritize human safety without impeding research.</p>
            <h4 class="sub-heading">Value from human engagement</h4>
            <p class="post-text">When arriving at MIT, Lorvo knew she wanted to pursue a course of study that would allow her to work at the intersection of science and the humanities. The variety of offerings at the Institute made her choices difficult, however.</p>
            <p class="post-text">“There are so many ways to help advance the quality of life for individuals and communities,” she says, “and MIT offers so many different paths for investigation.”

                Beginning with economics — a discipline she enjoys because of its focus on quantifying impact — Lorvo investigated math, political science, and urban planning before choosing Course 6-14.</p>
                <p class="post-text">As president of MIT’s Undergraduate Economics Association, Lorvo connects with other students interested in economics while continuing to expand her understanding of the field. She enjoys the relationships
                she’s building while also participating in the association’s events throughout the year. “Even as a senior, I’ve found new campus communities to explore and appreciate,” she says. 
                    “I encourage other students to continue exploring groups and classes that spark their interests throughout their time at MIT.”</p>
                <p class="post-text">Lorvo also values MIT’s focus on educating the whole student and has taken advantage of opportunities to investigate disciplines like philosophy through MIT Concourse, a program that
                facilitates dialogue between science and the humanities. Concourse hopes participants gain guidance, clarity, 
                    and purpose for scientific, technical, and human pursuits.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Understanding technology’s potential impacts on humanity, doing good, continually improving, and creating spaces where big ideas can see the light of day continue to drive Lorvo. Merging the humanities with the sciences animates much of what she does. 
                    “I always hoped to contribute to improving people’s lives, and AI represents humanity’s greatest challenge and opportunity yet,” she says. “I believe the AI safety field can benefit from people with interdisciplinary experiences like the kind 
                    I’ve been fortunate to gain, and I encourage anyone passionate about shaping the future to explore it.”</p>
